# Donkey Gym ML-Agents
This code is written at TNO during my graduation research project for the Artificial Intelligence degree at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.

This repository contains an OpenAI Gym environment for [ML-Agents compatible DonkeyCar simulator](https://github.com/vanmil/donkey-simulator-ml-agents). It is based on [Tawn Kramers OpenAI environment](https://github.com/tawnkramer/gym-donkeycar), but completely rewritten to be compatible with the new ML-Agents simulator version.
